# Welcome to my portfolio!!

Hi!! I'm Valerie, and this is my portfolio. Welcome!!

## Who am I? 
Right now, I'm a student! I'm doing a coding bootcamp at Concordia University to learn web development. We're learning full-stack development in just 3 months! Everything is new to me, but I'm always eager to learn new skills and hone them. 

Before that, I worked in the animation industry for almost 10 years, mostly doing 2D animation and character/props rigging. My love for animation might show a little bit throughout!

## What's in my portfolio?
You will find a little description of myself, some of the things I worked with, screenshots of previous projects (will update with newer projects whenever possible) and a way to contact me at the bottom.

In the future, when I have a little bit more free time, I plan on adding a section for animation demoreels. 

### Thank you for viewing my portfolio!!
